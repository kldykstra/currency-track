# Currency Tracker Analysis

An exploratory analysis of the cleanliness, completeness, and sufficiency of the
European Central Bank historical conversion rate data in order to answer
our business questions:

* What is the current exchange rate?
* What is the recent trend in the exchange rate?
* How does the current exchange rate compare to historical rates?
